Getting started:

1. Download and install the free version of Unity http://unity3d.com/unity/download
2. Download and install the Github app for your OS (http://mac.github.com/ or http://windows.github.com/) May or may not need to install git as well... haven't tested
3. In the github app, find 'stjahns/INTD450', and click 'Clone to Computer'
4. Start Unity. Click 'edit/open project', and point it to the directory you cloned the git repository to
5. Open a scene in the 'Project' pane (eg, TestScene)
6. Hit the play button, screw around, whatever

How to make + commit changes with the Github app: TODO)
