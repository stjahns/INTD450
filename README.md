Getting started:

1. Download and install the free version of Unity http://unity3d.com/unity/download
2. Download and install the Github app for your OS (http://mac.github.com/ or http://windows.github.com/) May or may not need to install git as well... haven't tested
3. In the github app, find 'stjahns/INTD450', and click 'Clone to Computer'
4. Start Unity. Click 'edit/open project', and point it to the directory you cloned the git repository to
5. Open a scene in the 'Project' pane (eg, TestScene)
6. Hit the play button, screw around, whatever

How to make + commit changes with the Github app:

1) Download the App that corresponds to your OS

2)Sign in and then go to github.com and log in 

3) You should see that you have been added to the Repo called INTD450 on the website 

4)On the right corner of the web page and while github app is running in the background ,click on Clone in Desktop it on the right bottom corner of the repo 

5)You should see the github app pop up and Cloning the Repo on your Desktop based on the location you specified .Most of the time it would be under Documents and settings Github folder ( for Windows  )

6)So now any changes you make to the files you need to re-sync with the repo .If you made any changes it would appear on the Github App ,it will show the changes and ask you to post a short comment on this update (Please make it meaningful) .After thats done and yes I think you need to put a short comment on what this commit is about, you press commit below the comment box and then sync on the top right corner of the App .This should push your commit to the repository.

7)IMPORTANT NOTE : to avoid conflict and overwriting other people work  before you start working on anything Sync with main the Branch so it could download the latest version of the files on the repo and after you push re-sync again .

8)Github App has a bug which it doesn't sync all the files at once,so a good practice is sync couple of times to make sure it didn't miss any files to update

For the Commit Comments I would propose that everyone to use this style ,its easy and saves time in writing .No need to write a really long description.A short one is enough 
At the beginning of each sentence use symbol legends :
For Update would be ^ 
For a new File or New Function loool use +
For deleted items use -
For Ignore * 

for example :
^ file Readme.txt with the sentence blaa blaaa 
+ Readme.txt 
- Readme.txt 
* Readme.txt 

However,if their is a significant change to the file that you need to write a really long description for it please please dont write it in the commit comments and put it in the comment box below the file on the webpage .Not sure if the App got it or not
